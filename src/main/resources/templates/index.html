<h2>Directions:</h2>
<p>Beat the egg in a bowl. Trim the crusts from the bread and break the slices into small pieces. Add these pieces to the egg.<br>
Mix in the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, Chesapeake seasoning and parsley, and beat well.</p>
<p>Place the crabmeat in a bowl and pour the egg mixture over the top. Gently toss or fold the ingredients together, taking <br>
care not to break up the lumps of crabmeat.
</p>
<p>Form the cakes by hand into patties about 3 inches around and 3/4-inch thick. Shape should be like a cookie, not like a <br>
meatball or golf ball. Place the cakes in the refrigerator for at least 45 minutes before cooking. This is very important so<br>
the cakes don't fall apart.
</p>
<h2>Broil the Crab Cakes:</h2>
    <p>Slip them under a preheated broiler until nicely browned, turning to cook evenly, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side.</p>
    <h2>Or saute:</h2>
    <p>Heat a small amount of butter or olive oil in a skillet and saute the cakes, turning several times, until golden brown or <br>
        about 8 minutes total cooking time.<br>
    <p>Serve at once with tartar sauce, mustard, or cocktail sauce on the side.</p>
